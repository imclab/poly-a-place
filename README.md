Poly A Place
================

Draw your universe. Paint the road, rivers, trees...
View demo : [Poly A Place](http://marcteyssier.com/experiment/poly-a-place/)

Objective
--------
This experiment is a test for me. I wanted to build a complete application based on HTML5 and canvas. The optimisation and implementation will probably never end (sorry guys). It is also my first steps with GitHub.

Running
--------

* Run `configure.php`
* Open `index.php` 


Compatibility
--------

Poly a place has been tested on Chrome 13.

* Known issues in Firefox 

TODO
--------


__Optimisation__
* Code with classes... (new tile, update,...) - [Design pattern](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/)

__Visual__
* Resizing viewports
* Remove the loader only when everything is loaded
* Build a new interface
* Improve drag and Drop
* New sprites to correct the 'white line'
* Trees (how to plant ? random ?)
* Add rows ? (.push)
* Zoom level (default /2 )

__Saving__
* Take a screenshot, Resize, Rename and Save
* Save data with tiles level

__Loading__
* Open saved sketch (use a `randname`) 
* Load tiles
Advanced loading - A new popup with :
* Search by Name, date, sketch name, thumbnail

__Network__
* Connection with a phone
* Create Different rooms

__Gameplay__

For the moment there is no gameplay in this experiment. Idea : Create a short race. The car follow a bezier curve. Use a velocity vector for the speed.
To move the car, press only the `space` key

* Build a car !
* Build a Start tile

__Other__
* Easy Sql configuration
* Clean the code, create classes (one class to build q tile, whitch contains all the oissible tiles)
